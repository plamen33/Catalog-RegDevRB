HTML Project Regional Development of Republic of Bulgaria

1/ This is a real released Project I developed back in 2008/2009.

2/ This project is a part of the officially released Catalog "Regional Development of Republic of Bulgaria",
which consists of 2 parts, a paper book and a CD web project. I took part in the development of the CD
version, which was actually a web based static HTML project distributed on a CD.

3/ The project is free for use and distribution.
It was developed under the order of Center of Industry of Republic of Bulgaria.

4/ For correct work use the portable web browsers in the project, inconsistency may be
experienced with up-to-date browser versions.
